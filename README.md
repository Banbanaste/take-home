# Take Home Task

## Prompt:
```
Exercise 3 Write some code that will accept a $ amount and convert it to the appropriate string representation.

Example: Convert $2523.04

to "Two thousand five hundred twenty-three and 04/100 dollars"
```

## Thoughts:
Was fun, some areas of improvement identified in the comments

Mainly:
- Use sting instead of array to construct the string representation
- implement error handeling
- look into recursive implementation
- look into necesity of hash maps (was cutting corners here)
